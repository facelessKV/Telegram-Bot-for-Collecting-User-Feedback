1. Open Telegram and find @botfather.



2. Send message: /Newbot



3. Follow the Botfather instructions:

   - Indicate the name for the bot (for example, "Feedback Collector")

   - Indicate username for the bot (should end at "BOT", for example, "My_FEDBACK_BOT")



4. Botfather will send you token, looking something like this: 1234567890: AABBCCCDDEEFGHIIJEGKLMNNOOPPQQQ



5. Copy this token.



### Step 2: Determination of your Telegram ID (for admin)



1. Find @userinfobot in Telegram



2. Send him any message



3. The bot will respond to you with a message in which your ID will be indicated (for example, "Your ID: 123456789")



4. Remember or write down this id



### Step 3: Bota File Setting



1. Open the BOT.PY file in any text editor.



2. Find the line:

   `` `

   API_TOKEN = 'Your_BOT_TOKEN'

   `` `

   

   Replace 'your_bot_token' with the token that you received from Botfather (be sure to save quotes).



3. Find the line:

   `` `

   Admin_id = 123456789

   `` `

   

   Replace 123456789 with your Telegram ID, which you received from @userinfobot (without quotes).



4. Save the file.

2. Go to the folder with the bot:

   `` `

   CD C: Users -Militer Detesktop Eedback_bot

   `` `



3. Run the bot:

   `` `

   Python Bot.py

   `` `



4. The bot is launched! Do not close the command line window until you want the bot to work.



### in linux:



1. Open the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).



2. Go to the folder with the bot:

   `` `

   CD ~/fedback_bot

   `` `

## The use of the bot



1. Open Telegram and find your bot by the name you indicated when creating.



2. Send the `/star 'command to get a welcoming message.



3. To leave a review, send the `/fedback` command, and then write your review.



4. Administrator (whose ID is indicated in the settings) can view all the reviews by sending the bottle of `/all_FEDBACKS`.



## important comments



1. The bot will work only while the script is launched in the command line/terminal.



2. If you want the bot to work constantly, you will need hosting or VPS.



3. All reviews are stored to the file of the Feedback.db database in the same folder where the Bot.py file is located.



## Elimination of problems



1. If the error "Modulenotfounderror: No Module Named 'Aiogram'" "occurs, check that you correctly installed Aiogram:

   `` `

   Pip Install Aiogram == 3.0.0

   `` `

   

2. If the bot does not respond to commands, check that you indicated the correct token.



3. If you cannot view the reviews as an administrator, check that you indicated the correct administrator ID.



4. If the bot has stopped responding to the commands, restart it (close the command line/terminal and run it again).
